# endangered-streets
A map showing streets with names containing endangered animals in The Netherlands

![Screenshot of the map showing endangered streets](screenshot.png)

Data was created in a separate project where I cross referenced a list of endangered species with streets listed in [this public dataset containing all streets in the NL](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/netherlands.html).

## Map tiles
- Looks like there's a good chance I'll go over the mapbox limit. [Here's an OS alt](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/website/leaflet/)
- A better option is [leaflet's own tile provider](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html)
